## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple socila link-sharing profile webpage. It includes HTML for structure and CSS for visual design and styling, covering typography. The project was built focusing on the desktop version. There are three files "active-state.jpg", "desktop-design.jpg", "mobile-design.jpg" in the design folder.  

The "active-state.jpg" shows how the webpage behaves whith "hover".
The "desktop-design.jpg" is desktop version of the webpage. 
The "mobile-design" shows mobile version of the webpage.

## Built with:
VSCode Visual Studio.
HTML.
CSS.

## My process:
1. Create HTML file named "index.html" to the markup language (website structure).
2. Create CSS file called "style.css" to style the website.

### What did I learned?
From the provided HTML and CSS, I've learned how to build and style a simple web page using foundational web development techniques. I've demonstrated the ability to structure content semantically with HTML, including headings, paragraphs, and images. On the CSS side, I've applied basic styling, such as controlling typography, colours, padding, marginssizing. 

### Continued development
I next step will be working with forms (understand how a basic form works in HTML, add interactive).

### Useful resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools was essential in building this project, offering clear tutorials on HTML and CSS that helped me understand content structuring and styling. Their practical examples made it easy to learn and apply key web development techniques effectively.

- [MDN - Mozilla Developer](https://www.example.com) - MDN Web Docs was crucial in building this project, providing in-depth, well-structured resources on HTML and CSS. The detailed explanations and examples on MDN helped me understand the nuances of web development and apply best practices effectively. This allowed me to create a well-crafted and responsive webpage with confidence..
