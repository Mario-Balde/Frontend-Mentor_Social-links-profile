## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple social link-sharing profile. It uses HTML for structure and CSS for styling. 
In the beginning, the project was built as a Desktop first. In the meantime, it was updated to a responsive design with "Mobile-First". The full functionality of this website can be accessed at https://frontend-mentor-social-links-profile-six.vercel.app/.
The website will display in different layouts depending on the device (mobile, tablet, desktop, etc). Therefore, for devices with a minimum of 1440px, the page will display the desktop version. 

## Built with:
VSCode Visual Studio (code editor)
HTML.
CSS.

## My process:
1. Create an HTML file named "index.html" to the markup language (website structure).
2. Create a CSS file "style.css" to style the website.

### What did I learn?
I've learned how to build and style a simple webpage using foundational web development techniques. I've demonstrated the ability to structure content with HTML, including headings, paragraphs, and images. For the CSS, I've learned how to style a page, by understanding the box model (content, padding, border and margin). 

### Continued development
The next step will be working with forms (understanding how a basic form works in HTML and adding interactive using JavaScript and React).

### Useful resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools was essential in building this project, offering clear tutorials on HTML and CSS that helped me understand content structuring and styling. Their practical examples made learning and applying key web development techniques easy.

- [MDN - Mozilla Developer](https://www.example.com) - MDN Web Docs was crucial in building this project, providing in-depth, well-structured resources on HTML and CSS. The detailed explanations and examples on MDN helped me understand the nuances of web development and apply best practices effectively. This allowed me to create a well-crafted and responsive webpage with confidence.
